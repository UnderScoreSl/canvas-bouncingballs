Bouncing Balls
=========

Now a days the Canvas is most popular additions of HTML5 Standards. So i thought to make a fun to build a HTML5 Canvas particles. This will generate the balls of random size where you click on the canvas or you can add it randomly on the canvas using the button. The balls will bounce in the canvas. you can also stop/start all the balls using the Stop/Start button. you can also remove all the balls from the using the remove button. There is also a counter of how many balls are there in Canvas.
